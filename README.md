# Invert first byte
Invert the first byte of a file. Can be useful to make your system stop crawling it. File is easily restored simply by running the program again.

Generated by Gemini 1.5 Pro, prompt:
```
Write a Java program that takes as input a filename, and invert the first byte of the file.
The program must run in less than 1 second even if the file is 1 terabyte.
Also:
If the file ends with a ".invByte1" filename extension, then remove that extension.
If it does not, then add that extension.
```
